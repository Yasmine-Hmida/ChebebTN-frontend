# ChebebTN-Frontend Part

This is the frontend part of **ChebebTN** built with **React Native** + [Expo](https://expo.dev) created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) responsible for the interfaces.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: React framework for building the mobile app. 
- **Axios**: Fetch or send data to APIs.
- **AsyncStorage**: Equivalent to LocalStorage in the mobile.
- **Expo**: A platform that makes building and testing React Native apps easier.

## Get started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ````
   git clone https://github.com/Yasmine-Hmida/ChebebTN-frontend.git
   ````

2. **Navigate into the project folder and Install dependencies:**
   ````
   cd ChebebTN-frontend
   npm install
   ````
   
3. **Start the app**
   ````
   npx expo start
   ````

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

I personally chose the **Android Emulator** as an option. <br>
You can view the app files inside the **app** directory.
